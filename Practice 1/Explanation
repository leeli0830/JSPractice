- Make 4 routes: "/", "/about-us", "/contact", and "/protected"

- Each routes should render a string with the name of the page, i.e: "/about-us" -> About Us.

- Make one middleware for all routes, that middleware should console.log the message "I'm a middleware" on every request to any route.

- Make a middleware that won't allow me to go to "/protected", if I try to go to "/protected" I should be redirected back to "/".
